# Jiyeong-Oh-CIFAR-10-Classification-with-MLP-and-ResNet-20
This covers the process of comparing two models: MLP and ResNet-20. By implementing each  model and using it to classify CIFAR-10 data, the goal is to understand how each model works and  analyze which model is advantageous for classifying image data.
